# Designers Should Adopt Sustainable Pace

# Hi!

---

# I'm @jonathanpberger


- My background is in
  - **philosophy** and then
  - **design** and now
  - **development**

- I read and write code every day to build products at **@pivotallabs**


---

# Software development had problems

---

- Sclerosis around processes and tools,
- Compulsive (CYA) documentation,
- Endless negotiation about targets and deliverables,
- A fixation on following an old plan in a new situation.

---

Hey designers, does this
# Sound familiar?

---

Software development has been revolutionized by Agile practices

# BUT

designers struggle to adapt the same techniques

---

#TL;DR
- Designers will benefit from adopting agile techniques.
- We should start with Sustainable Pace.
- This is a cultural shift we'll need to advocate for.

---

# Why Now?
- The Lean UX book is out!
- We're starting to codify some of these techniques!
- Now is a great time to review the intersection of Agile and Design

---

# Origin Story

---
I started as
# a self-taught designer

---

I worked on [Spot.Us](http://spot.us) and
# found Agile and fell in love.

---

# I wanted to bring Agile to design.

---
I found Pivotal, and
# they needed an Agile designer

---

#Sweet!

---

Now Pivotal is building
# a Product and Design practice

---

# 3 big areas for improvement:

- Acceptance Criteria-delimited design stories (what counts as 'done'?),
- Meaningful estimation of work for design (when will it be done?),
- A culture that values Sustainable Pace (how can we keep doing it?).

---

# Acceptance Criteria

## is hard.

- It'll require a better taxonomy of "done"
- The best design deliverable is the Simplest Thing That Can Possibly Communicate the Design Solution,
- this can vary from team to team and design problem to design problem.

---

# Estimation of work

- is hard too.
- And it depends on Acceptance Criteria.

<!-- The unit of work for the “what” of the story is “what’s the smallest possible thing that delivers value to the user?” and the “how” of the story is “what’s the simplest possible thing that can work?”. These units of work tend to translate poorly to design, because effective graphic design is almost always a system. Changing arbitrary pieces tends to degrade the whole.
 -->

---

# Sustainable pace

> Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

---

# What does it mean to maintain a constant pace indefinitely in design?

<!-- ---

# Pame sez

> I'm already lean, why do I need Sustainable Pace? -->

---

# Why Sustainable Pace First?

- its the most in our control
- its the foundation upon which we can build these other things
- we deserve to be happy
- it attacks the cult of the rock star
- it'll require a shift in our billing model (area of greatest risk)

---
# What do we have to do?

- We have to spread the word,
- argue about it,
- argue for it.

---
# It'll be an uphill battle
- But it's only a messaging problem (not a product problem).

---

# What does it mean
(besides 40-hr weeks?)

- better tools
	- repeatable ideas / technquiue technigue (look at the TQ tag on the design reto)
- a lot of this work is already being done by the Lean UX movement
- it helps to recognize it as such

# Notes

http://guidewiredevelopment.wordpress.com/2011/09/29/an-apology-for-agile-when-to-not-use-it-and-how-to-make-it-work/:


The first problem is killing developer productivity by constantly shifting priorities and directions.
The second problem is an inability for product owners to make well-informed tradeoffs around priorities.
The third problem is having too many unnecessary meetings and status checks.
The fourth problem is an inability to accurately predict when a project will be done, primarily with the aim of either cutting scope or moving the deadline (or adding developers, which is always dicey), and knowing that one of those will need to be done as much ahead of time as possible.
The fifth problem is frustrated developers due to poorly-defined features.
The sixth problem is the temptation to adjust the quality knob in order to meet a date target.
Lastly, this isn’t so much a problem per se, but agile builds in time for reflection on the product and the process.

At the core, I believe Agile Methodologists are really about "mushy" stuff�about delivering good products to customers by operating in an environment that does more than talk about "people as our most important asset" but actually "acts" as if people were the most important, and lose the word "asset". So in the final analysis, the meteoric rise of interest in�and sometimes tremendous criticism of�Agile Methodologies is about the mushy stuff of values and culture.

This type of situation goes on every day�marketing, or management, or external customers, internal customers, and, yes, even developers�don�t want to make hard trade-off decisions, so they impose irrational demands through the imposition of corporate power structures. This isn�t merely a software development problem, it runs throughout Dilbertesque organizations.

We plan, but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment.


- Constantly shifting priorities,
- An unwillingness to make hard decisions,
- Unnecessary meetings and busywork,
- An inability to accurately predict when a project will be done,
- Poorly-defined features,
- The temptation to adjust the quality knob in order to meet a date target,
- No time for reflection on the product and the process.
