# Hello!

Software development has been revolutionized by Agile development practices, but designers struggle to adapt to the very same techniques—despite suffering many of the same challenges that led to Agile. What exactly are these problems? And how can Agilists and designers address them? In this talk, we'll investigate some of these problems, and suggest solutions including:


In this talk, I'll share experiences introducing these concepts into several design practices, and suggest ways to incorporate them into your own practice.

Jeff's book is out! We're starting to codify some of this stuff! Now is a great time to review the intersection of agile and design

# 3 big areas for improvement:

- Acceptance Criteria-delimited design stories,
- Meaningful estimation of work for design,
- A culture that values Sustainable Pace.

# Acceptance Criteria

is hard. It'll require a better understanding of

The best design deliverable is the Simplest Thing That Can Possibly Communicate the Design Solution, and this can vary from team to team and design problem to design problem. Under ideal circumstances, an experienced designer may be able to reasonably estimate how long it will take to 1) solve the design problem, 2) communicate the solution, and 3) iterate on the problem / solution once it’s usable and testable as working software.

# Estimation of work

The unit of work for the “what” of the story is “what’s the smallest possible thing that delivers value to the user?” and the “how” of the story is “what’s the simplest possible thing that can work?”. These units of work tend to translate poorly to design, because effective graphic design is almost always a system. Changing arbitrary pieces tends to degrade the whole.

# Sustainable pace

> Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

---

# What does it mean to maintain a constant pace indefinitely?

---

# Pame sez

> I'm already lean, why do I need Sustainable Pace?

---

# Why Sus Pace First?

- its the most in our control

---
# What do we have to do?

We have to spread the word and argue for it. It'll be an uphill battle. But its a messaging problem.

---

# What does it mean
(besides 40-hr weeks?)
- better tools
	- repeatable ideas / technquiue technigue (look at the TQ tag on the design reto)
- a lot of this work is already being done by the Lean UX movement
- it helps to recognize it as such
